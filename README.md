# Flare_SHARP
Codes for analysing the relationship between flare bursts and SHARP parameters(/nlfff/pil_mask) study. Including IDL and python cods. IDL codes are the main part, python codes are specificly for pil_mask configuration and  discrete  Flare-SHARP relationship analysis.

If one wants to calculate boundaries of NLFFF, one should go the 'doundaries' in which all caodes are written in IDL. The codes are modified from @njuguoyang's codes.
If one wants to calculate PIL-mask for a Solar Active Region, one should go to PIL-mask file. The dbscan file branch is for calculating the coordinates of th points of the PIL-mask with dbscan method, whose codes are written in Python. The other branches are written in IDL.
If one wants to calculate direct current and return current of a Solar Active Region, one should go to dc_rc file.

If one wants to study the polarity inversion line and its impact on flare bursting of an active region, one can go to PIL_SHARP_calculation.
